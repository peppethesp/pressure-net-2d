# Network for pressure

This repository implements a network based on the approach described by:

This network makes essentially use of a Convolution Neural Network with pooling, resizing layers etc, to learn how to solve, in a physics informed manner
$\nabla^2 p = b$ where $ b = \nabla u $.

This is done by estimating $p$ through a neural network enforcing the following loss function to minimize:
$$\mathcal{L} = \mathrm{MSE} (\nabla u, \nabla^2 p)$$
